# SunPass-Test-July
Bazyl , good morning!
I didnt figured out how to copy several files from old project in VS code to new projest (that we have already connected to GitHub).
So I decided to go through all the way again.
This is what I did today:
I have created new project from scracth from memory without any written notes.
1. Greated remote depo in Github
2. Created local depo.
3. Installed NPM
4. Installed Cypres in that NPM (by the way - it jus needed to wait another 2 minutes for installation, we didnt wait on Satiday mornong)
5. Created gitignore (tampltaed files got from public source)
6. connected local and remote depositories.
7. Copied old js file with my first 5 cases in local depo and succesfully pushed it to remote.
8. Deleted in local depo duplicating file and updated this change at remote depo.
9. Im feeling excited!
10. Thank you@!
